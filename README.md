# ChoreDoor
Code Academy ChoreDoor Project. 


Project Purpose

This project created by CodeAcademy is a single page website intended to act as a functional game of chance. The user is simply asked to click on one of three the doors that appear closed. In order to win this game, the user must select the two doors containing images that are not the ChoreBot image before selecting the ChoreBot door. If the user picks the door with the ChoreBot behind it, they lose, but can keep on trying!
   
I really enjoyed working on this simple project since there were less detailed steps provided and left up to the user on how to complete it. I wanted to use this project as my first step into working on harder projects that I hope to find later on in the course and on my own. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are all utilized for this project. No special frameworks used since this project is intended to display the knowledge and skills developed after learning some basic Javascript. 

Although the code is complete, and it clearly does what it is intended to do per Code Academy requirements, I do believe it can be optimized. This project was given after learning basic Javascript and with new knowledge of loop syntax I believe it can be redone in a more efficient way. One issue I ran into was using a switch block that did not work. I decided to go with an if else block, but hopefully after a thorough review I can figure out what went wrong.
